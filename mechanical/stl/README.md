# stl
Models for 3D printing. GitHub can also render them natively.

## 3D Printing
The files here are already in a 3D-printer friendly format (STL). See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LBTkLsjHGQ) for a how-to.

## Viewing in GitHub
GitHub natively supports viewing STL models in the browser. Just click on any file like you would code and it will render it for you!
